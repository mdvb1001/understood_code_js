js code challenge

# Notes:
* In the js file, I added some functionality to submit the form with the "enter" key. I figured it would make the interaction with the app a little more seamless. After all, we are all so used to doing this...
* Decided to deal with the red styling through CSS. I suppose I could have used Javascript, but I think it was more efficient with the `nth-child` pseudo-class.
* I added the `preventDefault()` function to ensure that the page does not refresh/reload when clicking "Insert". I admit trying other simpler ways, but this has been the best solution so far.
* Put a little color to the background... just for fun at first. I realize now that it makes the input and button (where the action is!) pop a bit more.
